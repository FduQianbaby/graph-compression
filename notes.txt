The following is a list of ideas for things that could still be done
on this project.  Wildly ranging in scope, but I find this kind of
list helpful for keeping track of ideas.  They're in no particular
order.  Feel free to add to the list and/or to restructure the list
into "done", "might do", "for someone else to do later", "makes no
sense", etc.


* get the code working on a compute server (tzuyi-200716)

* test for correctness by having the while-loop randomly choose pairs
  of vertices and verifying that the reachability is correct.
  (tzuyi-200716)

* check your compression ratios against those in Table 1 of the
  original paper (use the same networks to see if you can reproduce
  their results) (tzuyi-200716)

* write up description of implementation (tzuyi-200716)

* collect results of running on range of networks, compression ratio
  for both scc and for the second phase (tzuyi-200716)

* write up experiments: results, tables, why these networks were
  chosen for testing - what are types of networks where reachability
  queries are useful/meaningful, etc. (tzuyi-200716)

* write up discussion/reflection.  e.g. section 3.2 has running time
  of O(|V|^2+|V||E|), relate compression to impact on that bound
  (tzuyi-200716)

* python code to automate the data collection (tzuyi-200716)

* optimize algorithm / data structures  (tzuyi-200716)
